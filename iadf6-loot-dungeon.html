17 фев 2017 - 6 мин.Loot Dungeon - Pixel Roguelike by Senri hin \rSubscribe my channel Hello, I would love to know what are the best minecraft mods out there to experience a good adventure with friends (online), something like a RPG with bosses, lot of unique dungeons and mobs, many loots. ect.! I thought it would be amazing to experience, hit me up with your best mods I would really appreciate. Ниже представлен список игр для консоли Sony PlayStation Portable. Обозначения игр, вышедших в разных регионах. Dungeon Loot Есть целый жанр странных игр, который я совсем не люблю. В отличии от других странных игр. Я не люблю рогалики. Все рогалики. 
The bonus item has only dropped once for me, yesterday, on the first dungeon I did. Now I don't get it anymore, I tried both queues (random and specific). Is this supposed to happen У некоторых пользователей встречается следующая проблема. После настройки в Outlook учетной записи Microsoft Exchange имена стандартных папок. I'm still playing the original Legendary edition, so please recommend mods for that. I'm tired of every dungeon crawl being the same. I either get a handful of junk items, or one good item that I just wind up selling because my equipment is stronger anyways. I also get the same items, over and over. What can I do to spice up the loot in my game? So far, these are in my load order: - Immersive Armors (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19733) - Warmonger Armory (https://www.nexusmods.co. Hi! During the last Ludum Dare, I've created in 72 hours a game called Loot & Looter (https://gamejolt.com/games/lootlooter/301835). It's an action dungeon crawler where you have to raid without mercy everything that comes at your hand, escaping from a horde of deadly skeletons guardians. I'm looking for any feedback! If you want to play it you can found it on GameJolt (https://gamejolt.com/games/lootlooter/301835) Cheers, Nick Zangus. I ''tried'' it on pc for 3 hours and now I got it for the vita, love it! I want to keep trying. It really can be punishing haha, you will fail and get frustrated sometimes, but it's great. 
Hi! during the last Ludum Dare, I've created in 72 hours a game called Loot & Looter (https://gamejolt.com/games/lootlooter/301835).

If you want to play it you can found it on GameJolt (https://gamejolt.com/games/lootlooter/301835) Cheers, Nick Zangus. As the title said, I'm looking for games similar to Diablo with a good looting system, a big or procedurally generated world, and fun combat. For example, if I do m+10 EoA, would the loot at the end only be loot you can get from EoA but just higher ilvl? Or is it just a random piece of loot in those chests. It's a mix of genres but here are the types of games I am talking about (even though I know some are not really similar) - Destiny (not on PC yet) - Firefall/Defiance (low pop) - I've played most MMOs out (not necessarily looking for MMO) - Warhammer-Vermentide (liked it but low pop hard to matchmake) - Warframe (liked it but just got burnt out) - Probably a lot more I'm not thinking of. - Diablo/Path of Exile/ Marvel heroes (burnt out) But can you think of any games like this with reasonable. First off I used the search function and didn't find exactly what I was looking for. I ran all the available dungeons in beta phase 3 and ran into a few issues with a few members of party through the duty finder over loot. Obviously I can only Need on things that my equipped class can use, the issue arised when a piece of equipment that is all classes would pop up that had stats that didn't immediately pertain to my current class and I would roll need. For example I was running The link for Loot dungeon on the sidebar simply takes you to a "not found" page for the play store. I'm assuming it got removed. Link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinjon.lootdungeon Edit: PS: for future reference, would this kind of post go under sub meta or modding flair. This video explains for you can get much more loot in dungeons and how to do it, it's so simple https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pGxa6hGltA Hope this helps you all, enjoy. So IF it's possible to summon via password on the short ritual root chalice, would someone be kind enough to create a dungeon that contains a Lost Ludwigs for my arcane character? I've done the chalice grind for two characters and really don't feel like doing a third right now. I've got the SRRC so if anyone can do this, please let me know. Glyph rxp5dirg would be perfect as it contains a blood I've been wandering around for a while trying to find a really good challenging dungeon with good loot, so post yours. 
How ridiculous is this dungeon event? 2 mythic dungeons that resulted in 0 loot except for worthless azerite and a hydrocore. What the hell is the point of having an extra loot dungeon event when the same dogshit RNG determines whether or not you actually get loot ? Why can't this RNG horseshit just drop one piece of loot per dungeon whether or not it's an ugragde or not? It's not even a cosmetic thing, it's retarded to spend up to an hour or more on a dungeon during a fucking dungeon event.
